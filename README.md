# Google maps InfoWindow

This library is design to easily add InfoWindow on Google Maps using html and CSS.
It supports by default CSS `animation` and `transition` for animation, but also accepts user controlled animations through any Tween library.
Transition behavior is highly inspired by @vuejs/transition.
